Webpage for Boelens Techniek Apeldoorn

The existing webpage was in dire need of a revamp so I made a new design and a JavaScript based back-end to replace the current PHP based implementation.
It is a single page with some minor user interaction and form validation logic. The back-end consists aditional data validation and an emailing component.
